/**
 * Plugin Name: Force Email Two-Factor (Enforcement)
 * Description: Requires the Two Factor plugin's Email provider for every user, so
 *              two-factor is mandatory at login while stronger factors (TOTP,
 *              hardware keys) and backup codes remain available. Enforcement
 *              defaults to ALL users, with optional per-role exclusions.
 *              Restricts the XML-RPC / REST API-login path to an allowlist of
 *              service accounts, and only when they authenticate with an
 *              Application Password.
 * Author:      —
 * Version:     1.3.0
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * INSTALLATION
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Drop this file directly into wp-content/mu-plugins/ as a FLAT .php file.
 * Must-use plugins in subdirectories are NOT auto-loaded, so it has to sit at
 * wp-content/mu-plugins/force-email-two-factor.php (not in a nested folder).
 *
 * Requires the Two Factor plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/two-factor/
 * If that plugin is inactive, every guard below no-ops safely (see notes).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EMERGENCY KILL SWITCH
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Email 2FA depends on outbound mail. If mail delivery breaks, every user who
 * has no stronger factor configured can be locked out. To disable ALL
 * enforcement in this file without deleting it, add to wp-config.php:
 *
 *     define( 'FORCE_2FA_DISABLE', true );
 *
 * Keep a known-good admin session or printed backup codes on hand the first
 * time you activate this, in case mail is misconfigured.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 */

defined( 'ABSPATH' ) || exit;

// If the emergency kill switch is set, register nothing at all and bail early.
// This is checked at load time so a broken-mail recovery is a single wp-config
// edit away, with no code changes here.

	return;

/**
 * Roles to EXCLUDE from forced two-factor.
 *
 * Default is an empty array → enforcement applies to ALL users. Add role slugs
 * (the lowercase keys, e.g. 'subscriber', 'customer', not display names) to
 * exempt those roles from having Email auto-enabled:
 *
 *     const FORCE_2FA_EXCLUDED_ROLES = array( 'subscriber', 'customer' );
 *
 * Security rule (see force_2fa_user_is_exempt): a user is exempt ONLY if EVERY
 * role they hold is on this list. A user with both an excluded role and a
 * non-excluded one (e.g. subscriber + editor) is still enforced, so excluding a
 * low-privilege role can never accidentally exempt a privileged account.
 *
 * Exclusion means "don't FORCE 2FA" — it does not forbid it. An excluded user
 * who configured their own 2FA keeps it.

/**
 * Make two-factor mandatory by ensuring the Email provider is enabled for every
 * user (except excluded roles — see FORCE_2FA_EXCLUDED_ROLES).
 *
 * Why this works: the Two Factor plugin treats a user as "using 2FA" whenever
 * they have at least one available provider. Two_Factor_Email::is_available_for_user()
 * returns true unconditionally and needs no per-user setup (it just mails a code
 * to the account address), so adding it as a floor forces the login challenge
 * for everyone — including users who never configured anything.
 *
 * Why APPEND (not replace): returning array( 'Two_Factor_Email' ) would strip
 * each user's stronger factors (TOTP, hardware keys) AND their backup codes on
 * every read, forcing the whole site down to email-only and removing the
 * recovery path. Appending instead guarantees an email floor while leaving any
 * stronger, user-chosen factor in place and primary.
 *
 * Fail-safe: if the Email provider class is absent (plugin inactive/removed) we
 * return the list untouched. We never silently delete an existing factor, and
 * we never inject a provider key the plugin can't resolve.
 *
 * @param string[] $enabled_providers Provider class-name keys enabled for the user.
 * @param int      $user_id           User ID (unused — policy is uniform).

 *                  when that provider exists.

/**
 * Service-account allowlist for non-interactive API logins.
 *
 * Background — what the API-login path is and how the plugin already guards it:
 * the interactive wp_login 2FA challenge does NOT cover XML-RPC or REST logins.
 * For those paths, the Two Factor plugin's default policy is to allow a login to
 * skip 2FA ONLY when the request authenticated via an Application Password (it
 * keys off did_action('application_password_did_authenticate')). A plain
 * real-password login over XML-RPC/REST is therefore already blocked for any
 * 2FA-enabled user. Our enforcement filter above makes every user 2FA-enabled,
 * so that default applies site-wide.
 *
 * What THIS allowlist adds: the plugin's default still lets ANY user log in via
 * the API as long as they present an Application Password. We tighten that to a
 * named set of service accounts — non-human integrations that cannot present an
 * emailed code, e.g.:
 *
 *   - Headless / JAMstack frontends reading content over the REST API
 *   - CI/CD or deploy pipelines hitting authenticated REST endpoints
 *   - Automation platforms (Zapier / Make / n8n / IFTTT) posting via REST
 *   - Backup, migration, or uptime-monitoring tools
 *   - The Jetpack / WordPress mobile apps (XML-RPC)
 *
 * The resulting policy is the INTERSECTION of two conditions (see filter below):
 *   (a) the account is on this allowlist, AND
 *   (b) THIS request authenticated with an Application Password.
 * So an allowlisted account that tries its real login password over the API is
 * still denied, and a non-allowlisted account is denied even with an app password.
 *
 * Each entry is EITHER a numeric user ID (int or numeric string) OR a user_login
 * (matched case-insensitively). Prefer IDs — they don't change if a login is
 * renamed.
 *
 * Hardening expectations for any account you add here:
 *   1. It authenticates with an Application Password (Users → Profile → Application
 *      Passwords), NOT the real login password. App passwords are per-integration,
 *      individually revocable, and never satisfy condition (b) when the real
 *      password is used instead.
 *   2. It has the least-privilege role the integration actually needs.
 *   3. You remove it from this list the moment the integration is retired.
 *
 * Leave the array EMPTY to deny ALL API logins (no service accounts permitted).
 *
 * @var array<int|string> User IDs and/or user_login values permitted on the API path.
